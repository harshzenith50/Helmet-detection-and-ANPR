# Motorcycle licence plate extraction when rider not wearing helmet 
This is project is extracting motorcycle license plates if the rider or back sitter is not wearing a helmet.

In this project i am using yolv5 algorithm to detect rider, licence plate and riders head. Then using resnet50 image classifier, i classify wheather the rider is wearing a helmet or not. If not wearing a helmet then, it will save his licence plate number in a image folder, and also will capture rider image in a separate folder.
